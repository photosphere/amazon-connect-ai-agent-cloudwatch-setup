"""Step 3: block until the ingested data is visible to Logs Insights.

Batch evaluation reads BOTH halves of the ingested data through the Logs Insights
index, and each half has its own lag. Starting a job before either one is
queryable fails every session in it, so both are gated here:

Note the two halves are also indexed under DIFFERENT timestamps, so each needs
its own query window: a log event lands at the time PutLogEvents ran, but a span
document lands at the span's own startTimeUnixNano, which for a replayed session
is in the past. ingest.py records that range as `spanTimeRange`.

  * span documents in "aws/spans" (written via the X-Ray OTLP endpoint). If these
    are not indexed yet, the job fails with
        ValidationException: Provided input contains N log event(s) but no span
        documents. Log events alone cannot be evaluated
  * log events in the runtime log group (written via PutLogEvents). If these are
    not indexed yet, the job fails per session with
        LogEventMissingException: Span with ID <id> ... is missing a
        corresponding log event
    The FIRST batch written to a freshly created stream can stay invisible for
    well over 15 minutes even though GetLogEvents returns it immediately
    (recordsScanned: 0.0). Re-writing the identical messages under fresh
    timestamps reliably makes them queryable in ~90s.

So the gate is: poll both indexes -> if the events are still missing when the
budget runs out, re-write them with current timestamps -> let Step Functions
retry -> only start evaluation once both sides are visible.

Failing loudly here is much cheaper than a job that reports 0 completed sessions.
The one thing to get right is that the gate must fail only when the data really
is missing: both presence tests read the raw message instead of a discovered
field (see PARSE_QUERY), because a query that can never match turns this gate
into a deadlock. REQUIRE_SPAN_INDEX=false skips the aws/spans half if a region
still refuses to cooperate.

# The gate must NOT depend on Logs Insights automatic JSON field discovery.
#
# A deployment in eu-central-1 (customer report, 2026-09) had the span documents
# physically present in "aws/spans" - `fields @message` returned the full span
# JSON and `filter @message like /spanId/` matched all 12 records - while
# `filter ispresent(spanId)` matched 0 records, run after run (recordsScanned 12,
# recordsMatched 0). Whatever the reason - spanId was simply not queryable as a
# field there - `missing_spans` stayed at 100%, all 5 attempts burned, and every
# run died in WaitIndexed with LogEventsNotIndexed while the data it was waiting
# for was already there. It is region- or account-specific, not universal: the
# same query works on aws/spans in us-east-1, so it cannot be relied on either
# way.
#
# `parse` reads the raw message text, so it is independent of discovery, and this
# pattern covers both serializations the gate has to read:
#   aws/spans, written by X-Ray (compact)  ->  "spanId":"3d58446444af52bb"
#   runtime log group, our own json.dumps  ->  "spanId": "3d58446444af52bb"
# Checked against real data in us-east-1, where discovery does work, and it
# returns exactly what the old query returned: 5/5 span documents in aws/spans,
# 213/213 log events in a runtime log group. spanIds are md5[:16] (converter.py),
# hence the fixed 16 hex digits.
